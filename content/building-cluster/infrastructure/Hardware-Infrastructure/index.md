## Why we chose UpBoards?
We chose this UpBoard model thinking about reutilizing some parts from our store (UpBoards) that wasn't more being used in the instituition. Some time ago, UpBoards were used in Robotics, but went replaced by RaspBerry Pi 4.
The chosen Upboard has a x86 architecture, which can provide many resources. The UpBoard is compatible with many softwares that requires necessary a x86 architecture.

## Applications

We can use UpBoards for many different purposes, in the list below you can see three of them:

- Exoplanet Hunter
- Distributed Computing (MPI)
- Black Hole Simulator
