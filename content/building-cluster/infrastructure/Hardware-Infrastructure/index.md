- System Memory –  4GB DDR3L-1600
- Storage – 32 GB eMMC flash
- Video Output / Display – HDMI 1.4b, MIPI DSI/eDP interface
- Audio I/O – HDMI, I2S
- Connectivity – Gigabit Ethernet
- USB – 4x USB 2.0 host ports, 2x USB 2.0 pin header, 1x micro USB 3.0 port
- Camera – MIPI CSI up to 4MP
- Expansion – 40-pin Raspberry Pi compatible header
- Misc – Power button, RTC
- Power Supply – 5V/3A via 5.5/2.1mm jack
- Dimensions – 85.60 x 56.50 mm

## Why we chose UpBoards?
Our selection of the UpBoard model was based on our intention to repurpose unused UpBoards from our inventory. These boards had previously been employed in robotics but were supplanted by the Raspberry Pi 4. Our chosen UpBoard boasts an x86 architecture, offering numerous resources, and is compatible with a wide range of software that necessitates this architecture.

## Applications

We can use UpBoards for many different purposes, in the list below you can see three of them:

- Exoplanet Hunter
- Distributed Computing (MPI)
- Black Hole Simulator
